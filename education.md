## Engineering Diplomas

> We offer two types of certifications for all diplomas. Deep Blue Certified Diploma and Mantissa College Certified Diploma (Malaysia) for 1 year certification. And both the studies courses & syllabus are same. But the difference is that Mantissa College diploma will cost additional $400 for exam fees. Not included in Deep Blue Certified Diploma.

### Available Diploma

- **Computer Science Diploma**
- **Robotic Engineering Diploma**
- **AI Engineering Diploma**

> We are proud to have already trained many students from Korea, London, Singapore, and Thailand who have gone on to work as employees in IT and engineering, including robotics companies in other countries. Our students have a deep understanding of the latest tools and technologies in the field of AI and robotics and are equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to pursue successful careers in this exciting field.
